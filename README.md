In progress I Wanna Be the Destination STG Clone for Portfolio

Assets and Boss design from the game "I wanna be the Destination" by a dev who calls himself Carnival
I just wanted to start my STG engine and worry only about code, not design

Blue and Yellow attacks not coded yet. 
Space Bar left in as a dev tool. It will re-roll your attack if you get Blue or Yellow and want to skip it
